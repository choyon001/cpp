For binary search alway remember some things .that are given below

-> element should be in monotonic funtion ...monotonic funtion means that elements should be in order either increasing or decreasing 
-> for example:
    ->{2,5,22,55}
    ->{55,34,33,5,3}

 For binary search always keep in mind for things . that are

    ->No.1  :  find the mid index
    ->No.2  :   check the key value with mid
    ->No.3  :   if(key==index value){ return mid value}
    ->No.4 :    else{ go either before mid or after mid }
    ->No.5 :   basically mid = (start + end)/2
    ->No.6 : but for the safe from int range we will use 
            mid = start+((end-start)/2)  [start int = 2^31 -1 and end int = 2^31-1 than the plus of these both will be out of int range so we will use this mid equation ]
